Articles of my personal blog: https://glegoux.com :smile:

Each folder in `articles/` matches with an article `YYYY-MM-DD-<title>`. It should contain at most:

- **README.md**: contains a link with the related online article
- **images/**: contains the images of this article
- **references/**: contains the references of this article.
- **code/**: contains code or project relative to this article.

Note: `YYYY-MM-DD` is the publication date (not the last update date) and `<title>` is the normalized title of the article.
